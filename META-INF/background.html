					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>In remote antiquity, the concept about intellectual property
						did not exist. Ideas were originally the common property for the
						literate elites. Articles were published by hand-copying. Scholars
						were able to make any digest or commentary on other works, which
						could consequently contain as much or as little initial materials
						as the author desired. During that time period, there was no
						standardized system of citation. Thousands of years ago, cheating
						was first prevalent on the Chinese civil service exams. Before the
						founding of the Modern Language Association and American
						Psychological Association at the end of 19th century, there was no
						any set rule describing properly cite quotations from others’
						writings, which may have caused many cases of plagiarism nowadays.
						In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, cheating was widespread
						over all the college campuses. Therefore, it was no longer
						considered as academic dishonesty among students. “College
						fraternities” often operated so-called essay mills, where some
						kinds of term papers were kept and be resubmitted continuously by
						different students. Nevertheless, the name of the paper was
						modified. Plagiarism, as defined in the 1995 Random House Compact
						Unabridged Dictionary, is the “use or close imitation of the
						language and thoughts of another author and the representation of
						them as one’s own original work”. In academic, it is seen more
						broadly as the adoption or reproduction of original intellectual
						creation (such as concepts, ideas, methods, pieces of information
						or expression, etc.) of another author without due
						acknowledgement, in contexts that originality is acknowledged and
						rewarded.</p>
